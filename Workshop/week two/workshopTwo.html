        <dt><strong>Use of Alt and title attribute in images</strong></dt>
        <dd style="width: 50%;"> Alt provides alternative information about the picture like what the image is about or
            about anything in
            images. THe alt makes crawlers to identify about the images, might help you get your page rank higher as
            well. </dd>
        <blockquote cite="https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text" role="nofollow">Adding alternative text to images on your site is a principle of web accessibility.

            Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a
            person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the
            page.

            Alt text will be displayed in place of an image if an image file cannot load.

            Alt text provides better image context/descriptions to search engine crawlers, helping them to index and
            rank an image properly in image search. It also provides search engines with contextual information about
            the content on the page</blockquote>
