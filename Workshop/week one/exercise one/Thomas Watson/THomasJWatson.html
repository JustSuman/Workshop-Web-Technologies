        <p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 to June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the
            chairman
            and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
            developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He
            turned
            the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines.
            A
            leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's
            greatest salesman when he died in 1956.</p>

        <li><strong>Famous Attribution</strong></li>
        <p style="width: 50%;">One of the first attributions is in the German magazine Der Spiegel of May 22, 1965,
            stating that IBM boss Thomas Watson had not been interested in the new machines initially, and when the
            first commercial calculation behemoths appeared in the early 1950s, filling whole floors with thousands of
            heat generating vacuum tubes, he estimated the demand by the US economy at a maximum of five. <a
